        <li>User can detect the disease of the plant using the uploaded image of the leaf of the
            plant using the mobile application.</li>\n
        <li>User can either upload a photo from the gallery that has already taken or can take a
            live photo use the camera in the application and uploads.</li>\n
        <li>User can understand about the different plant diseases using the plant disease button
            in the home page.</li>\n
        <li>Just use your mobile number for creating your the account.</li>\n
        <li>User can contact a plant pathologist for further more clarrification using the expert
            connect button.</li>\n
        <li>The result is shown as text bellow the diagnose button and the accuracy is shown below
            it from the range 0 to 1(i.e if it shows 0.5 the accuracy will be 50% and if it 1.0 the
            accuracy will be 100%.</li>\n\n
        <b>Details</b>\n\n
        Agri-Doctor is an Android Application that would allow farmers to treat their plant diseases
        in a series of steps which are predefined in our system. We are using Tensorflow library
        (Machine Learning library) to detect plant disease. The farmers can use their smartphone to
        scan a particular plant leaf which they suspect for having a plant disease. We have
        generated custom re trained tensorflow models using the possible plant diseases. Here we are
        retraining a tflite model. The model is pre trained with common classifications, but on top
        of it we are training it with various leaf diseases. We then analyse the plant diseases,
        symptoms etc and then predict the plant disease.\n
